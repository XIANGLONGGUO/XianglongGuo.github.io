## Research Interests

-   Formerly, I have been working on the problem of **heat haze effects
    with Digital Image Correlation (DIC)**, which includes the study of
    how to dehaze,the effects of traditional dehaze algorithm and the
    mothods based on deep learning.

-   Recently, I have been working on a project of **DeepLearning-based
    DIC network for local displacement measurement**, which includes
    establishing a benchmark for optical flow model used in DIC.

-   I am also strongly interested in **Computer vision for science**,
    actively looking for opportunities to work on projects related to
    it.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------
  -    Benchmark the performance of various traditional physical
        defogging methods and deep learning defogging methods in the
        thermal fog effect, and test whether the defogging method is
        effective in the DIC field.

 -    Learn the DeepLearning-based DIC network for local displacement
        and strain measurement, and optimize the methods of it.
