Welcome to my homepage!

I am a senior undergraduate student in the Department of Engineering Mechanics at BeiHang University. I am currently working on the research of deep learning-based Digital Image Correlation (DIC) for local displacement measurement. Previously, I worked on the problem of heat haze effects in DIC, exploring defogging methods using both traditional techniques and deep learning.

My research interests include:
* Deep learning-based DIC network for local displacement and strain measurement.
* Optimizing deep learning models for real-time image analysis.
